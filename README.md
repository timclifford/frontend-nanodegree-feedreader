Frontend Nanodegree Feedreader
=============================

A JavaScript feedreader app tested using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) as part of the [Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree] (https://www.udacity.com/course/nd001).

This project provided experience with writing tests for an application using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/).

**Aim:**


* Show how to use Jasmine for testing purposes. The tests proved to be useful in testing the underlying functionality of the application, the business logic,as well as event handling and DOM manipulation.

###How to run the tests:

To run the tests, clone it from my github account:

```
git clone https://github.com/timclifford/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader.git
```

and then open index.html in your browser.

The Jasmine spec results will show at the bottom of the window.

###Results:

* All required tests pass.
